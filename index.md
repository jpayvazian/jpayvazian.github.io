## About Me
Hi! My name's Jack Ayvazian and I'm a student studying Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) pursuing a BS/MS for 2023.
I'm interested in Software Engineering and looking for summer internships!
Besides programming, I enjoy things like soccer, basketball, videogames, and music.

## Project/Work experience
### Math Puzzle
This individual software engineering project introduced the Entity Boundary Controller (EBC) framework.
The game is a java swing applet where the object is to make directional math operations to a 3x3 grid of numbers to end with a single number in the middle tile.

### Software Engineering Final Project
For this group project, we designed a web-based application to help teams decide among alternatives for a proposed event.
In our group of 3, my role was mainly developing the back-end Java code and managing the SQL database and API.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) was used to host the application.

You can find a video demo for this project [here](https://youtu.be/Laqw_whi3tk)!
