## About Me
Hi! My name's Jack Ayvazian and I'm a student studying Computer Science at Worcestor Polytechnic Institute (WPI).
I'm interested in Software Engineering and looking for summer internships!
Besides programming, I enjoy things like soccer, basketball, videogames, and music

## Project/Work experience
### Software Engineering Final Project
For this group project, we designed a web-based application to help teams decide among alternatives for a proposed event.
In our group of 3, my role was mainly developing the back-end Java code and managing the SQL database and API.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) was used to host the application.
