## About Me
Hi! My name's Jack Ayvazian and I'm a student studying Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) pursuing a BS/MS for 2023.
I'm interested in Software Engineering and looking for summer internships!
Besides programming, I enjoy things like soccer, basketball, videogames, and music.

## Projects
### Math Puzzle App
This individual software engineering project introduced the Entity Boundary Controller (EBC) framework.
The game is a java swing applet where the object is to make directional math operations to a 3x3 grid of numbers to end with a single number in the middle tile.

### Software Engineering Final Project
For this group project, we designed a web-based application to help teams decide among alternatives for a proposed event.
In our group of 3, my role was mainly developing the back-end Java code and managing the SQL database and API.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) was used to host the application.

You can find a video demo for this project [here](https://youtu.be/Laqw_whi3tk)!

The source code for these projects can also be found in my [github repositories](https://github.com/jpayvazian?tab=repositories).
### “Game of Life” 
For this Operating Systems project, I recreated a distributed version of John Conway’s Game of Life in C++ where multiple threads were implemented to carry out each generation of the game. Semaphores were also used as a synchronization mailbox system between threads to allow each thread to signal when the assigned board cells were finished computing.

### “Verifying Munitions” Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP)
This interdisciplinary project was with a team of 5 students and UK sponsors from the disarmament organization SCRAP. My primary role was revamping a Global Weapons Tracking website in WordPress and HTML/CSS, while adding mobile-friendly support. We also used Python to create an interactive map on large weapon stockpiles to advocate global transparency.

## Work Experience
### Student Teaching Assistant
On top of my own school work, I work with professors to help teach introductory Computer Science courses at WPI. This job entails holding office hours to provide feedback and guidance for students and other tasks such as grading quizzes and exams.
