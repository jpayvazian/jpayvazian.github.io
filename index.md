### About Me
Hi! My name's Jack Ayvazian and I'm a student studying Computer Science at Worcestor Polytechnic Institute (WPI)
I'm interested in Software Engineering and looking for summer internships!
Besides programming, I enjoy things like soccer, basketball, videogames, and music

### Project/Work experience
# Software Engineering final Project
For this group project, we designed a web-based application to help teams decide among alternatives for a proposed event
In our group of 3, my role was mainly developing the back-end Java code and managing the SQL database
Amazon Web Services (AWS) was used to host the application

You can find a video demo for this project [here]()!
